## Overview

### The challenge

- Model Snap card game using Java
- Use Test-Driven Development (TDD)


### How to play
- üë• The game is played by two players: Player One and Player Two.
- üÉè A deck is shuffled and the top card is shown to start the game.
- üîÅ Players take turns drawing cards by pressing ENTER.
- üì£ If the symbol of the new card matches the previous one, a "Snap" opportunity is triggered.
- ‚è±Ô∏è The current player has 2 seconds to type "snap" to win the game.
- ‚úÖ If they type "snap" in time, they win.
- ‚ùå If they type it incorrectly or too late, they lose.
- üèÅ The game ends when a player successfully snaps, or when there are no cards left in the deck (draw).

### Run the Game Locally
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/edpau/no_cardGame_snap.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory
```
cd no_cardGame_snap
```

3. Compile the project
```
javac -d out src/main/java/org/example/Main.java
```

4. Run the game
```
java -cp out org.example.Main
```


## My process

### What I learned
- Please read my [Learning Log](./docs/LEARNING.md) here

### Continued development
- Allow the player to choose to replay the game instead of exiting after one round
- Add a reusable command-line menu system to handle user input and actions in a structured way
- Allow the player to rename the player name
